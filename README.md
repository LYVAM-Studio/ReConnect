## About the Game

ReConnect is a 3D singleplayer and multiplayer educational video game project. It takes
place on an extraterrestrial planet named Edenia. The player is sent to this planet for
communication maintenance. His goal is to fix these communications and repair his ship
so he can return to Earth.

To do so, the player will have to solve electrical and electronic puzzles to evolve in
the game and progress. The further the player advances in the game, the more difficult
the puzzles will be. At the end of the game, the player will have acquired electrical and
electronic skills equivalent to those taught in high school.
